# Member Board
A bulletin board application that lets users create posts for others to see. A post's author and date of posting can only be seen by other members.
This project was created to learn user authentication and to solidify my knowledge on Express, routing, and CRUD operations.

The application can be viewed at [https://member-board.herokuapp.com/](https://member-board.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
Created posts are available for the public to see and will not require an account. Users will be required to sign-up to create an account in order to create their own posts 
and to see the authors and creation date of other posts.
